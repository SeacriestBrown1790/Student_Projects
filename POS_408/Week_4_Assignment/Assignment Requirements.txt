The Software Development Company requests you add user error exception handling capabilities to the C# program.

For this week's assignment, build on the Week Three Individual Assignment, "Branching in C#," by storing the data input by the user in a class.  
You will also use this stored data when you display the data. 
The C# class must include the type of employee as either W2 or 1099 using the following requirements: 
	- The 1099 software development employees' records do not include or calculate any taxes
	- The program properly handles and informs the user about errors on user input
	- The program demonstrates in the code the use of references types
	- The program displays on the console all the software developers' data, monthly pay, monthly taxes, annual gross pay, annual taxes, and net pay
	
Using Visual Studio® and C# programming concepts, write a program to meet the specifications of the company's request. 
The program should have the following characteristics:
	- Compile and Execute without errors
	- Meets specifications by displaying on the console a welcome message along with allowing 
          the user to enter the following information on three software developers:
		~ Software developer name
		~ Address
		~ Gross monthly pay
		~ Annual gross pay
		~ Employee type: W2/1099
		~ Monthly and annual taxes determined by employee type
	- Data is stored in a class
	- Data that is input is displayed properly from the class.
	- Logic flow is clear, concise, and effective; 
          demonstrates exception handling routines and reference types 
          by catching and displaying user data entry errors and implementing reference types as part of the code
	- User inputs and outputs should be clear on screen
	- Validation for input types and data format
	- Appropriate indentation to logically illustrate program structure
	- Identifiers logically describe use
	- Naming conventions are consistent
