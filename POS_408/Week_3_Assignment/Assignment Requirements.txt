The Software Development Company now requests you enhance the C# program to display 
on the console additional information on all the software developers' information:
 
For this week's assignment, build on the Week Two Individual Assignment, "Adding Variables," 
by asking the user to enter the names, addresses, and monthly gross pay of three software developers. 
The program should display on the console the software developer name, address, monthly gross pay, and taxes paid for that month. 
Taxes are set at 7% of the monthly gross pay. 
The program should also display the annual gross pay and annual taxes of all three software developers. 

Using Visual Studio® and C# programming concepts, write a program to meet the specifications of the company's request. 
The program should have the following characteristics:
	- Compile and Execute without errors
	- Meets specifications by displaying on the console a welcome message along with allowing 
          the user to enter the following information on all three software developers:
		~ Software developer name
		~ Address
		~ Gross monthly pay
		~ Monthly Taxes
		~ Annual gross pay
		~ Annual taxes
	- Data entered is displayed back to the user and taxes are properly calculated.
	- Logic flow is clear, concise, and effective
	- User inputs and outputs should be clear on screen
	- Validation for input types and data format
	- Appropriate indentation to logically illustrate program structure
	- Identifiers logically describe use
	- Naming conventions are consistent
